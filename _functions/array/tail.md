Create a function called `tail` which is identical to `init`, but instead returns a list containing all elements except the first.

**Note!** There are also two special cases for `tail`:

  - if `tail` is given an array with a single element, it should return an empty list; `[]`
  - if `tail` is given an empty array, it should return an empty list; `[]`
