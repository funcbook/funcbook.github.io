# What and why?

You don't have to create your own hammer to be able to build a house. Software development, however is a different matter; you _can_ and are encouraged to create your own set tools to be able to better understand the tools that you use in your day-to-day work.

A _utility library_ (also known as _toolchain_, _tool belt_, _utility belt_) is a good way to not only get familiar with creating small, reusable functions, also provides a good way to get experience with writing documentation, ensuring consistent coding style, unit testing, test coverage, creating your own library to release on the NPM registry, as well as setting up an automated pipeline to ensure you the library you're using will work in a (somewhat) predictable manner.

Not all of these steps are mandatory, but let's consider if you do everything in this book, you will learn:

- know how to easily set up a new project
- enable code bundling and compilation
- write clear, concise and useful functions
- add documentation to your functions to generate documentation
- add tests and get code coverage reports
- how to combine everything into a reusable library
- the anatomy of an NPM module allowing you to understand existing modules you install better
- publish the library to the NPM registry
- set up an automated process to build and verify your code works
- set up code analysis tools to flag potential code problems

Like I mentioned, _you do not have to do all of these steps_, but if the theme of a chapter is not clear to you or you don't know how it works, I _strongly_ recommend you to go through that chapter. You may feel like writing the library's code itself plays a minor part when thinking about it from the context of the entire project ("pieni osa kokonaiskuvasta?") and to this I would say it's both true and false. Writing the code itself is a fairly minor part if considering the whole project, as there are a lot of other related tasks you will need to perform as well.
