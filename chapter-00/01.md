# Requirements

To be able to follow through, you are going to need the following things installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), **v8** or later
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - not mandatory, but strongly recommended

After these two are installed, you can continue to the next chapter.

## Later on

At some point later on in this book, we will be setting up automatic CI triggers and code coverage checkups using cloud services. You don't have to register to them right now, this will just work as a heads-up so that you are aware of that this will also be covered in this book.

However, if you'd like to, you can register to the services in advance. It's recommended that you link them to your Github account.

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/) - sign up for the open source plan

## Additional recommendations

There are some additional recommended tools that you can install:

* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#node-version-manager---) - the Node Version Manager
