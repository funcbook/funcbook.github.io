# Requirements

To be able to follow through, you are going to need the following things installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), **version 8** or later
    * If you have Node.js installed but are unsure about what version it is, run `node --version` to find out
  * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - not mandatory, but strongly recommended
  * Git for version control

After you've made sure that what's listed above is installed, read on.

## Later on

At some point later on in this book, we will be setting up automatic CI triggers and code coverage checkups using cloud services. You don't have to register to them right now, this will just work as a heads-up so that you are aware of that this will also be covered in this book.

However, if you'd like to, you can register to the services in advance. It's recommended that you link them to your Github account.

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/) - sign up for the open source plan

## Additional recommendations

In addition to the things listed above, listed below are some worthwhile additions that can be of help.

  * [nvm - the Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#node-version-manager---)
    * Allows you to have multiple versions of Node.js installed and allows you to switch versions easily
