# The purpose of this book

This book is meant so serve as a learning aid and/or guide on how to create your own library, how to set up the required (or recommended) build steps, get familiar with writing unit tests, writing your own utility/toolbelt library, and finishing up on publishing this library on the NPM registry as a module you can install and use in your projects.

In detail, what I hope to be able to teach you or at least help you to get familiar with, is:

* The basics of setting up a new Node project with code compilation and unit testing
* Setting up a linter and formatter to ensure and enforce a consistent coding style
* Starting unit testing from the beginning to break the mental image of unit tests being a painful experience
* Introduce a number of helpful functions and utilities that you can reuse throughout your projects
* Getting familiar with functional programming concepts that can help you a lot in your day to day development process
* Set up a Continuous Integration pipeline to ensure that what is published works
* Set up a code quality service that can check for potential problems from your project
* Creating an NPM module that will be published in the NPM registry
