"One of the best programming skills you can have is knowing when to walk away for awhile."

This book is meant so serve as a learning aid and guide on how to create your own library, how to set up the required—or recommended—build steps, get familiar with writing unit tests, writing your own utility library, and publishing this library on the NPM registry as a module you can install and use in your projects.

In detail, what I hope to be able to teach you or at least help you to get familiar with, is:

{% include "../_templates/attention.md" %}

* The basics of setting up a new Node project with code compilation and unit testing
* Setting up a linter and formatter to ensure and enforce a consistent coding style
* Starting unit testing from the beginning to break the mental image of unit tests being a painful experience
* Introduce a number of helpful functions and utilities that you can reuse throughout your projects
* Getting familiar with functional programming concepts that can help you a lot in your day to day development process
* Set up a Continuous Integration pipeline to ensure that what is published works
* Set up a code quality service that can check for potential problems from your project
* Creating an NPM module that will be published to the NPM registry
