Unless you are familiar with creating a new project and setting up the build pipeline, I recommend you to read through this book in the order it is presented.

{% include "../_templates/attention.md" %}

I would also like to mention that you refrain from copying and pasting code found in this guide, as typing things out will help you develop mechanical memory and routine in programming. Like the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) in photography, often the best way to learn when and how to take shortcuts is after first getting familiar with why things are done the way they are.
