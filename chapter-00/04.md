# The Plan

  - plan is to roughly implement the following
    - operating on lists
      - head, last, init, tail, uncons
      - append, prepend, insert
      - take, drop
      - map, reduce, filter
      - join, split, splitOn, splitEvery
    - operating on objects
      - keys, values, entries
      - toPairs, fromPairs
      - assoc, dissoc
      - has, prop, propOr
    - functional utilities
      - compose, pipe, seq
  - in addition the things listed above, we'll create some derivatives
    - lists
      - take -> takeWhile, takeEnd, takeWhileEnd
      - drop -> dropWhile, dropEnd, dropWhileEnd
      - filter -> reject, rejectUnless
      - reduce -> reduceRight/foldRight, scan, scanRight
    - objects
  - and some more advanced things later on
    - functions
      - curry, curryN
      - invoke, construct, constructN
