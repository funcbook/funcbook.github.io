title: The Plan
wip: true
---

  - may seem heavy on theory, but trying to keep things minimal at the start
  - things should be described as "normally" as possible, with things marked as _advanced_ that aren't mandatory
  - the birth: project "meta"
    - creating the project skeleton
      - npm
      - git repo
    - webpack
      - why
      - why webpack
  - the release: publishing to the npm registry
    - creating the library itself
    - publishing it to the npm registry
    - using pushed library in another project
  - the code: what we'll be doing
    - plan is to roughly implement the following
      - operating on lists
        - head, last, init, tail, uncons
        - append, prepend, insert
        - take, drop
        - map, reduce, filter
        - join, split, splitOn, splitEvery
      - operating on objects
        - keys, values, entries
        - toPairs, fromPairs
        - assoc, dissoc
        - has, prop, propOr
      - functional utilities
        - compose, pipe, seq
    - in addition the things listed above, we'll create some derivatives
      - lists
        - take -> takeWhile, takeEnd, takeWhileEnd
        - drop -> dropWhile, dropEnd, dropWhileEnd
        - filter -> reject, rejectUnless
        - reduce -> reduceRight/foldRight, scan, scanRight
      - objects
    - and some more advanced things later on
      - functions
        - curry, curryN
        - invoke, construct, constructN
