- [Requirements](01.md)
- [Purpose of this book](02.md)

## Requirements

You'll need the following installed:

 * Node.js
 * Yarn (optional)

## The purpose of this Book

> Leap in and try things. If you succeed, you can have enormous influence. If you fail, you have still learned something, and your next attempt is sure to be better for it. -Brian Kernighan

 - To be written

Main points:

 - Get familiar with creating a Node project
 - Create a set of often-used utilities and functions that come in handy a lot of the times
 - Get into a routine of writing tests for your functions
 - Create an NPM module and publish it to the NPM registry so it's easier to use the _handyman_ in your other projects
 - Familiarize yourself with useful concepts that can help you in creating simple and elegant functions and utilities that will save you time in the long run
 - Set up a linter to ensure consistent coding style
 - Set up automatic code formatting to enforce consistent coding style

## Using this Book

Unless you are familiar with creating a new project and setting up the build pipeline, I recommend you to read through this book in order.

I would also like to mention that you refrain from copying and pasting code found in this guide, as typing things out will help you develop mechanical memory [?] and routine in programming. Like the [rule of three](http://wiki) in photography, often the best way to learn when and how to take shortcuts is after first getting familiar with why things are done the way they are.
