# Checkpoint

So now the basic setup of your project is done.

What you've created:

- a base Node module project
- set up code compiling (or, _transpiling_ from "_transform_" and "_compile_"), not important right now, that's for later
- created an entry point
- tested out that the compilation works

## What your project looks like right now

```tree
.
├── .gitignore
├── dist
│   └── main.js
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── index.js
├── test
├── webpack.config.js
└── yarn.lock
```

Proceed to the next chapter, where we'll implement tests before starting to write code.
