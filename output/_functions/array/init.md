Create an exported function called `init` that takes an array and returns a new list of all elements but the last.

**Note!** There are also two special cases for `init`:

  - if `init` is given an array with a single element, it should return an empty list; `[]`
  - if `init` is given an empty array, it should return an empty list; `[]`
