wip: true

  - like it or not, JavaScript is web's "assembler"
  - JavaScript's typing
    - it's not as bad as you remember
    - `'use strict'`
    - think before you write
  - functional programming support
    - while being imperative by heart (?)
    - allows for functional-style programming
    - functional-style programming has its advantages
    - and also has its disadvantages
      - especially if you are not used to programming in functional-style
